        description: `I had not planned on being here. I wasn't supposed to be here. I was supposed to be hiking someplace further north, heading towards Canada via the Pacific Crest Trail.
        But that's a different story for another time. It was June 2020 and absolutely everything in the world had gone to shit. 
        The global pandemic was wrecking havoc on everyone's lives. Unemployment skyrocketed, homes were lost, and lives were taken by a virus that would cause discord in ways we would never imagine.
        It was only just the beginning. Uncertainty rippled through every facet of our lives. When would we able to see our family & friends again? When would businesses reopen and allow us to reclaim lost jobs?
        When would an approved vaccine be availabe? When would we return to normal? When would this all be over? That's question the world is still asking itself nearly 2 years later.
        It was precisely this state of paranoia that led me to repeadetly say, "I can't believe we're here," to my friend Kevin as we walked around the Yosemite Valley in late June before we
        started walking the John Muir Trail.\n\n Over the last several years, I'd ventured to Yosemite countless times. It's granite walls never fail to impress me. 
        I'm always transported to a place that brings me a level of peace and tranquility that's unmatched with any other place I've been to. I've been the majority of my twenties
        adventuring to this place with lifelong friends, new friends, old lovers, and new ones. It sounds silly to say "I grew up in here," because that phrase is usually referred
        to one's years prior to reaching adulthood. Yosemite is so goddamned beautiful. So beautiful that it made me realize that the way I was living was not.
        Yosemite gave me healing, community, and inspiration for how I want to live the rest of my life. So yeah, I grew up here.\n\n
        Like everything else that year, Yosemite National Park was closed to visitors from March until about early June. It was unbelievable. What do you MEAN the outdoors are closed?
        Like most of my decisions in life, deciding to hike the John Muir Trail came impulsively and last minute. Permits for this trail are notriously difficult to come by. 
        Typically, interested hikers enter through a lottery system sometime in late winter prior to starting anywhere between June and August. Because of the lottery system,
        it's not uncommon for some folks to be rejected several years in a row. The pandemic did provide one silver lining. In addition to the lottery system, there is an alternative to securing a
        permit, which is by showing up to the park in person, on the day before you intend to start hiking and hope that you're first in line for the allocated "walk up permits."
        Because of the social distancing transpired by the pandemic, "walk up permits" were not deemed COVID friendly. So those allocated walk up permits were not being 
        distributed online. If you're tech savvy enough, getting one of these golden tickets was a walk in the park. Pun intended.\n\n
        So here we were! Fresh off the bus, packs loaded with 6 days of food and gear, and hearts full of unexplicable joy. I felt like a kid getting ready to start summer camp.
        We were really doing this thing. We were IN YOSEMITE.  `
